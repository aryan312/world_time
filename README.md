# world_time

A new Flutter project.

Build a real-time world time viewer app using google's crossplatform framework Flutter where the user can select from a wide range of cities across the globe. The multiscreen app makes use of advanced asynchronous codes to navigate through the routes/screens. Http package was used to fetch the world time information from the api. A brief modification was also made to the UI through the day/night indications.
